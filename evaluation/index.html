                <h5 class="card-title">Mission Statement</h5>
                <p class="card-text">As we enter the school we can hear the uproar of high school students going about their everyday activities, leaving class, pulling out homework, talking with friends, and making general noise. As we continue our tour of the school we get to the classroom we are interested in. Inside is quiet with concentration, and the tacky sound of fingers flying on a keyboard. We are looking at a computer science classroom, as we look around we notice that less than 42 percent of the students are of different ethnicities. (Marken & Crabtree, 2021) That is why code.org has vowed that “We believe every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, identity, family income, neighborhood, or where they are from.” (Code.org, 2022). This means that we want to include all students and open the way for students of underrepresented minorities to have access to and take advantage of computer science classes in their schools. The focus of this evaluation will be to determine if we are holding up to our goal of increasing diversity in computer science classrooms.</p>

                    <h5 class="card-title">About <a href="https://code.org">Code.org</a></h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Code.org is an innovation education non-profit organization that focuses on putting computer science classes in high schools all over the United States. They point out that in expanding computer science classes they want to encourage the participation of women and minorities in taking any computer science. They want to increase diversity in the work environment by reaching out to everyone regardless of race, ethnicity, or income status. They don’t only focus on students though, they have classes that teach teachers how to teach computer science in a new way or for the first time. This is one of the many tactics code.org uses to further its goal of reaching out to students of every kind. Outside of helping schools start computer science classes they have several classes themselves that they run or teachers can borrow curriculum from them.</p>

                        Another way to measure the success of this small part of our mission statement is to look at participation numbers. How many students are participating in computer science classes? How many schools are participating in our program to offer computer science classes? This in-depth look at the participation of students and schools will help us understand the impact we are making to help everyone have an equal opportunity to learn a STEM concept.

                  <h5 class="card-title">About Participation</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">The other criterion we want to look at to measure the success of our mission statement is the participation number of students in computer science classes in high schools. This for example is a chart showing where computer science classes are relatively available. Very few students show interest in a computer science class claiming you have to be “very smart” (Vegas & Fowler, 2020) or you have to have a “geek gene” (Vegas & Fowler, 2020). This bias against computer science decreases the amount of participation in these classes, which in turn leads to more disparity in the workforce and classes which Google found to be the most influential factor in whether people took computer science classes. Resources like our Hour of Code campaigns can help change this bias. But the Hour of code assessments “do not provide the kind of rigorous impact assessment one would need to make a definitive conclusion of their effectiveness” (Vegas & Fowler, 2020). But campaigns like this are able to work. Georgia for example saw an increase in participation when it launched summer camps and weekend workshops. (Vegas & Fowler, 2020)  But it is as of right now unforeseen whether our efforts are making headway into this bias.</p>

                    The first evaluation criterion we will look at is diversity. According to our mission statement, we want to improve access to STEM classes, mainly computer science, for everyone regardless of other factors. One way to check to see if this is working is by looking at how diverse computer science classes are. This will show us how much improvement we have made in opening access to underrepresented minorities.

                  <h5 class="card-title">About Diversity</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">The chart above shows how many people took the computer science advanced placement exams for different years. It then shows the number of total people who took these exams and how many of those were of each race or ethnic group. This data clearly shows that the diversity of people who are taking computer science classes has been improving over the past few years, which is in accordance with our goal. However, we can not take full credit as there are other programs out there that also seek to improve computer science diversity, such as the CSTA or the Computer Science Teachers Association. But even with all the work from others to help these numbers still aren’t matching up with what we want. These numbers aren’t even which means we still have a lot of work to do.</p>

                        The last way to look at our progress is to analyze whether our efforts are having the desired effect on the computer science work field. Looking at ethnicity or gender percentages for the job field for the past five years. How many of those people took a computer science class in high school? This newfound knowledge will help us determine if the effort we go through to provide computer science classes to everyone has the desired effect in the job market.

                  <h5 class="card-title">About the Effect</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">The third way we will look to measure the success of our campaigns to improve involvement and diversity will be to look at the diversity of the computer science job market. This chart again shows the diversity of the job market as of 2021. (Fry et al., 2021). As we can see from the graph UDM workers or underrepresented minority workers still have dramatically less stance in the computer science field than what our goal is. But there has been a dramatic increase in the number of college students graduating with a STEM degree. But even so “there is little indication that diversity in related jobs will shift substantially in the near term” (Fry et al., 2021). While we are making headway in getting our goal accomplished there is still hope for what we can achieve.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">To summarize our learnings, we found that while we are making headway into the biases that plague the computer science classroom our efforts have not extended to the computer science job market. This means that we still have a lot more work to do to encourage more participation in these classes. Our Hour of Code campaign among others is helping to make this goal a reality. Together we can help improve the diversity of the actively growing field. </p>
