                <p class="dropcap">After working in fast food for a year and a half to learn to despise the phrase ‘the customer is always right’. I work
                as a PM Kitchen Steward for Cafe Zupas, which is their fancy word for dishwasher. So from five pm to ten pm I am the one
                in charge of making sure your dishes come out sparkling clean. And trust me customers are so crazy willing to wait
                twenty minutes in line for food they could get cheaper elsewhere and just generally making your life hard and not
                caring. Frequently I have looked at my salary and the amount of effort, toil, stress, and tears went into that number
                and think. It’s not enough.<br>
                &emsp;I work as hard and as fast as I can. I act happy to make customers happy. I act like I am not tired to be not tired. I
                act not hungry so I’m not hungry. I act as if my life isn’t falling apart so it won’t. I really should be in a different
                job by now, but I’m stuck doing the same amount of time in the same place making the same amount. This feeling of
                uncontrolled led me to start thinking seriously about my money where it all goes and how much my time is worth.
                (70% and 1% stat here). That is insane. I once did the math and it is literally worth my time to pick up a penny off the
                ground. I make about 0.003 dollars a second and it takes me two seconds to pick up a penny and so I make more money
                picking up that penny than I do a second working. However Jeff Bezos makes (insert number here) a second. So you are
                literally wasting thousands of dollars when you waste his time. How is this fair in any way? But slowly I came to the
                realization that he spent thousands of hours making his thousands. I spent 28 hours making my hundreds. So in one way it
                is fair, but I don’t have to like it.</p>
