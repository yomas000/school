                <p class="dropcap">The recent pandemic has shown us many things about our systems that are in place,but one thing I want to focus on is how
                computers and the internet have changed the school system for hopefully the better. Better schooling, better jobs, and
                computers will play a pivotal role in this system. For example a study found that 17 million people have a job because
                of the internet which was made possible because of computers (Walters, 2021). And one person is taking this fact and
                applying it to the continent that has the worst computer access and internet access. Only 40 percent of Africa can
                access the internet. (Kamer, 2022).

                <div class="quote-left rounded text-center">
                    <h2>My Grandmother never went to school. But always told us to bring home degrees.<br><br>I gave her my graduation gown. She still wears it.</h2>
                    <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/nelly_cheboi" id="quote-link" target="_blank">Nelly Cheboi</a>
                </div>
                &emsp;Nelly Cheboi is a 29 year old African woman who is intent on changing this statistic. Because of her circumstances she
                was forced to raise her younger sister at age 9. Through her hard work later in life she landed a scholarship to
                Augustana College in the United States, where she discovered her passion for computer science. It was hard for her at
                first “She handwrote papers and struggled to transcribe them on a laptop.” (Torgan, 2022) but because of her
                determination she persisted. One of her teachers said, “She didn’t always know the right answer or write the right
                computer code right off the bat. She had absolutely great determination — nothing was going to hold her back.”
                (Augustana College, 2022<br>
                
                &emsp;Nelly Cheboi saw what no one else did. That computers could change the world for small rural communities in Africa. They
                could have access to better teaching tools, to more knowledge than ever before. Now armed with this knowledge and an
                incredible determination she co-founded a non-profit organization called TechLit Africa that brings computers in from
                companies getting rid of them to make computer labs in rural African schools. She now has 10 working computer labs with
                100 in the process, they have helped over 4,000 students and 20 teachers. (Cheboi, 2022).<br>

                &emsp;They say knowledge is power and these computers will bring more knowledge to African students, empowering them to make
                more of their education and help them better their own situation. Nelly once said, “TechLit is my opportunity to fix
                poverty, and for good this time.” (Cheboi, 2022)
