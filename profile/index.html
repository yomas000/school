                <p class="dropcap">Out in the blistering heat of rural Africa a small girl who looked to be about nine was struggling to pick some wild
                vegetables on the side of the road. This food was on her way to and from school. It was her and her family's only food
                for the day, all the vegetables were small and shriveled things that could barely feed the girl who picked them. But she
                happily walked back to her home expecting a great meal that night from the great haul of food. This poor girl was taking
                care of her family at the age of nine.<br>

                <div class="quote-left rounded text-center">
                    <h2>My Grandmother never went to school. But always told us to bring home degrees.<br><br>I gave her my graduation
                        gown. She still wears it.</h2>
                    <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/nelly_cheboi" id="quote-link" target="_blank">Nelly Cheboi</a>
                </div>

                &emsp;Fast forward a few years later and tons of determination. This poor rural girl had gotten a scholarship to Augustana
                college in the United states. Nelly Cheboi’s determination to help others grew along with her knowledge. She saved all
                her college money working campus jobs to build a small school for kids in rural africa to help them lift themselves out
                of poverty. “This is my chance to end poverty. And for good this time” (Augustana College, 2022). In early 2016 Nelly
                sat with a large group of her friends with square tassel hats and large blue gown waiting their turn for a piece of
                paper that certified their knowledge that she and her friends worked so hard for. In 2016 Nelly got her Bachelor's
                degree in computer science.<br>
                
                &emsp;And her love of computers carried into her quest to help end poverty. So she and her friend
                started a non-profit company called TechLit Africa that recycles old computers into new computer labs.
                Nelly has now established more than 10 computer labs in rural kenya helping more than 4,000 students and 20 teachers.
                She has plans to establish 100 more computer labs in the next year, following their goal of 10 times growth a year.
